Based on the judging criteria and the requirements in the ZetaChain brief, your project already covers most of the essentials. However, to maximize your chances of winning first place, consider the following targeted improvements and polish:

---

## 1. **Developer Experience & Onboarding**
- **Video Walkthrough:** Add a short demo video (e.g., GIF or YouTube link) showing a cross-chain NFT transfer between Solana and ZetaChain.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Create simple, stepwise guides (with screenshots) for:
  - Setting up the environment (for both Solana and EVM developers)
  - Running a full cross-chain transfer (end to end)
- **Quick Start Script:** Provide a single command/script that sets up everything (dependencies, build, deploy, example run).

---

## 2. **Documentation & Clarity**
- **API Reference:** Auto-generate or hand-write a clear API reference for both the Rust program and TypeScript SDK.
- **Architecture Diagram:** Add a visual diagram in the README or `/docs/` showing contract flows, TSS, and messaging between chains.
- **FAQ Section:** Address common pitfalls, edge cases, and troubleshooting steps.

---

## 3. **Testing & Security**
- **Test Coverage Badge:** Add a badge to the README showing automated test coverage (use a tool like tarpaulin for Rust).
- **Fuzz/Property Testing:** Demonstrate the use of fuzz testing or property-based testing for smart contract logic.
- **Formal Verification:** If feasible, document any use of formal verification tools (even partial findings for critical functions).
- **Multi-Sig/TSS Test Vectors:** Include test vectors proving TSS signature validation and replay protection.

---

## 4. **Solana-Specific Robustness**
- **Compute Budget Examples:** Show how your program manages/optimizes compute units in practice. Add examples with high-load transfers.
- **Rent Exemption Utilities:** Ship a helper script that checks/ensures all accounts are rent exempt.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Explicitly document and test for edge cases like account re-initialization, account closure, and out-of-order message delivery.

---

## 5. **Open-Source & Ecosystem Impact**
- **Reusable Modules:** Split utility logic (e.g., cross-chain message parsing, TSS validation) into easily reusable crates/modules.
- **Templates & Boilerplate:** Provide an example repo/template for new projects to build on your NFT program for ZetaChain/Solana.

---

## 6. **Creativity & Bonus Features**
- **NFT Metadata Extensions:** Offer an optional extension for dynamic or upgradable NFT metadata that works cross-chain.
- **Cross-Chain NFT Explorer:** Build a simple web interface or CLI tool that visualizes cross-chain NFT states/movements.
- **Interoperable Standards:** Suggest or implement a standard for universal NFTs’ metadata/ownership proofs across EVM and Solana.

---

## 7. **Community Engagement**
- **GitHub Discussions:** Enable and seed GitHub Discussions for Q&A and feedback.
- **Issue Templates:** Create well-structured issue/bug report templates.
- **Responsive Support:** Make sure issues and PRs are answered promptly (document expected response times).

---

## 8. **References & Compliance**
- **Direct Reference to standard-contracts/issues/72:** Clearly document in your code and README how/where you address each recommendation or requirement from this issue.
- **Audit Readiness:** Even if you haven’t had a formal audit, list your audit-readiness steps and plans (who, what, when).

---

### **Summary Table for Judges**
Include a table mapping each judging criterion/requirement to where it’s satisfied in your repo. This makes it easy for judges to verify your compliance!

If you want, I can help you generate:
- A README improvements checklist
- An example architecture diagram (ASCII or markdown)
- A compliance mapping table
- Example scripts or docs for the above
