# Overview

This is a Universal NFT Program for ZetaChain Cross-Chain Interoperability built on Solana. The project enables secure cross-chain NFT transfers between Solana and EVM chains through ZetaChain's interoperability protocol. The system uses Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) for secure cross-chain operations, implements replay protection, and provides Metaplex compatibility for token metadata standards.
